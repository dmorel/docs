# Why does he do that? Inside the minds of angry and controlling men, Lundy Bancroft

### Note on terminology

Abusive man and abuser are used in this book to define any man who has problems with angry or controlling behaviour. Any of these behaviour has serious consequences and can lead the victim to confusion, depression, anxiety or fear. So even men who are not typically labelled as abusers since they don't tick all the boxes are referred to by this term in this book, as soon as they exhibit one of these behaviours. Any coercion or disrespect by a relationship partner is an important problem.

### Introduction

- 15 years conselor, evaluator, and investigator, more than 1000 cases.
- problem of abusiveness has little to do with how he feels, but is about how he thinks.
- purpose of the book is to help women.
- book is based on 21 most frequent questions women asked.
- wide spectrum of abusers, you may think the person is not one because he has good sides. But all of them are “men who chronically make their partners feel mistreated or devalued.”
- observations also apply to same sex couples, and to all cultures and nationalities.
- Motivation for men to attend trainings would be to salvage their relationship, but they firmly believed in the validity of their excuses.
- Not much difference in the effects of physical vs psychological violence.
- Men will distort the story, you must listen to the women's detailed account.
- Men will use victim blaming (spouse and children), are attached to the privilege they earned through their abuse, makes it difficult for them to be in a respectful and equal relationship with a woman.
- Very few men make substantial and lasting changes, but the counseling work is still important for society and primarily the victims.
- Prevalent feature of an abuser is *they tell you what you should think and tries to devalue your perceptions and beliefs*.
- Single most critical step you can take toward building a life that is free from control or abuse: not staying isolated.
- Takes all mental space, so the victim tries to fix the problem and not think about herself or the kids. First step is to identify the issues, then to bounce back, and put one's life in the center, not his.

## Part 1: the nature of abusive thinking

### Chapter 1: The mystery

- Every woman tries to make sense of the roller coaster ride (the abuser changes all the time, and can be good)
- "I just can't seem to live up to what he needs"

#### The tragedy of abuse

- Widespread problem: 2 to 4 million women assaulted per year in the U.S., cause for depression and substance abuse, 1,500 to 2,000 murders per year. 5 million kids witness assault on their mother every year.
- Only touching the surface, because emotional abuse is much more widespread.
- Difference in emotional vs physical isn't big, it grows from the same roots and is driven by the same thinking.
- Most abusive men simply don’t seem like abusers. So when a women feels a trouble in the relationship, she may not see it for what it is.
- Symptoms of abuse: escalating frequency of put-downs. Selfishness. Verbal explosions. Grievances. He knows what is good for her. Mounting sense of fear or irritation.
- She loves him so tries to make sense of an elaborate and evasive puzzle.
- Mood changes are especially perplexing. Puts her on the defensive, yells, is inaccessible to reason, then the next moment presents the face of a hurt child. But the beast will be back.
- Friends and other people will all have a different opinion on the abuser. Often blaming the situation partially on the victim who allegedly "triggers" the explosions.
- The woman knows from living with the abusive man that there are no simple answers.

#### Five puzzles

- His version of the abuse is worlds apart from hers.
- He gets insanely jealous, but in other ways he seems entirely rational.
- He suceeds in getting people to take his side against her, even therapists (who should always hear the woman's story, but they don't). An abusive man is not a realiable source of information on his partner.
- During some incidents he seems to lose control, but certain other controlling behaviours of his appear very calculated. They can be extremely manipulative.
- Sometimes he seems to be really changing, but it tends to vanish.

The abusive man *wants* to be a mystery. To get away with his behaviour and avoid responsibility, he needs to convince everyone that his behaviour makes no sense. He creates confusion because he has to.

He wants the woman to believe that she at least shares the blame. But abuse is not the product of bad relationship dynamics. Abuse is a problem that lies entirely with the abuser.

Inside the mind of an abuser, there is a world of beliefs, perceptions, and responses that fits together in a surprisingly logical way. Under the surface there is a human being with a comprehensible and solvable problem.

### Chapter 2: The mythology

The abuser wants you to figure him out, making you look in the wrong direction and make sense of his past, whereas the problem lies in how he thinks. He will fill your head with excuses and distorsions, and will keep you weighed down with self-doubt and self-blame.

It is a serious problem to allow abusers to analyze and account for their own problems. Because they will fool everyone.

#### A brief exercise

At the beginning of presentations, the author asks the audience to list the reasons abusers are what they are. People always come up with the common myths, and rarely with truths.

1. **He was abused as a child**
   - Weak link and other predictors are much more reliable. Usual therapy doesn't work, because it helps him develop an even more sophisticated defense system, and his pattern of abusiveness doesn't change. But special programs may bring some change.
   - By focusing on what his mother did, he can blame yet another woman.
   - Society refuses to acknowledge that it's a man's problem by blaming the mother.
   - Abusers often are litterate in psychology, turning exchanges with their partner in a therapy session for her where he outlines her supposed issues.
   - "I'm abusive because the same thing was done to me" is a common excuse, rarely stands up to reality. A non-abusive man doesn't use his past to mistreat you.
   - If you are so in touch with your abusive childhood, you should replicate it less, not more, because you know how it feels. It's just an excuse.
2. **His previous partner hurt him**
   - Pretends the woman was cheating on him, without any proof.
   - Says she wanted to control him, wouldn't let him have any freedom, turned their children against him. Usually describing his own behaviours but attributing them to the woman.
   - If it is an excuse for mistreating you, it's a distorsion: a man mistreated wouldn't use this to get away with hurting someone else. Past experiences can explain how one feels, but not how ones behaves in a "retaliatory" fashion. Stop believing anything he says.
   - If he presents himself as a victim, is aim is to play on your compassion so he can avoid dealing with his problem.
3. **He abuses those he loves the most**
   - Feelings cause behaviour? Wrong. Although our feelings can influence how we wish to act, our choices of action are determined by attitudes and habits.
   - Many people reserve their *best* behaviour to those they love most.
   - Wide acceptance in society that passion and aggression are linked to an intense relationship.
4. **He holds in his feelings too much**
   - The pressure cooker theory
   - It's wrong: most abusers express their feelings liberally and have an inflated idea of their importance. When he feels bad, he thinks that life in the family should stop until someone fixes it. "His partner’s life crises, the children’s sicknesses, meals, birthdays—nothing else matters as much as his feelings."
   - It's not *his* feelings that the abuser is too distant from, but everyone else's an in particular  his partner's and his children's. He knows very little about that.
   - Focusing on the abuser's feelings is counterproductive, that's what he wants.
   - The tension buildup is caused by his lack of empathy *for the partner's* feelings, and a set of attitudes. He explodes when he gives himself permission to do so.
5. **He has an aggressive personality**
   - A great majority of abusive men are calm and reasonable with everyone except their partner. If he had an aggressive personality, it wouldn't be reserved to their partner.
   - Class and racial stereotypes come into play (blue collar, non-white). The reality is different. Sometimes education is a weapon to tie even more intricate knots.
   - Sidenote: beware, men who intimidate other people routinely will intimidate their partner at some point too.
6. **He loses control**
   - He breaks her stuff, not his. He lets her clean up the mess.
   - He knows at which point to stop. When asked what made him stop, they can always find a reason (kids, fear of police, etc). Most common one: "*I would never do that to her*". So he does not really lose control, does he?
   - An abuser almost never does anything that he himself considers morally unacceptable. He may hide what he does because he thinks others would disagree with him, but feels justified inside.
   - He never ever says: “There’s no way I can defend what I did. It was just totally wrong.”
   - An abuser's core problem is that he has a distorted sense of right and wrong.
   - "*you can't call your mother a bitch*" (but your partner, yes) so it's not that much of a loss of control. He thinks mistreating his partner is justifiable.
   - think of an abuser as an acrobat in a circus ring who does “go wild” to some extent but who never forgets where the limits are.
