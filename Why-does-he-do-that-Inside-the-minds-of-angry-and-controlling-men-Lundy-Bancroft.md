# Why does he do that? Inside the minds of angry and controlling men, Lundy Bancroft

### Note on terminology

Abusive man and abuser are used in this book to define any man who has problems with angry or controlling behaviour. Any of these behaviour has serious consequences and can lead the victim to confusion, depression, anxiety or fear. So even men who are not typically labelled as abusers since they don't tick all the boxes are referred to by this term in this book, as soon as they exhibit one of these behaviours. Any coercion or disrespect by a relationship partner is an important problem.

### Introduction

- 15 years counselor, evaluator, and investigator, more than 1000 cases.
- problem of abusiveness has little to do with how he feels, but is about how he thinks.
- purpose of the book is to help women.
- book is based on 21 most frequent questions women asked.
- wide spectrum of abusers, you may think the person is not one because he has good sides. But all of them are “men who chronically make their partners feel mistreated or devalued.”
- observations also apply to same sex couples, and to all cultures and nationalities.
- Motivation for men to attend trainings would be to salvage their relationship, but they firmly believed in the validity of their excuses.
- Not much difference in the effects of physical vs psychological violence.
- Men will distort the story, you must listen to the women's detailed account.
- Men will use victim blaming (spouse and children), are attached to the privilege they earned through their abuse, makes it difficult for them to be in a respectful and equal relationship with a woman.
- Very few men make substantial and lasting changes, but the counseling work is still important for society and primarily the victims.
- Prevalent feature of an abuser is *they tell you what you should think and tries to devalue your perceptions and beliefs*.
- Single most critical step you can take toward building a life that is free from control or abuse: not staying isolated.
- Takes all mental space, so the victim tries to fix the problem and not think about herself or the kids. First step is to identify the issues, then to bounce back, and put one's life in the center, not his.

## Part 1: the nature of abusive thinking

### Chapter 1: The mystery

- Every woman tries to make sense of the roller coaster ride (the abuser changes all the time, and can be good)
- "I just can't seem to live up to what he needs"

#### The tragedy of abuse

- Widespread problem: 2 to 4 million women assaulted per year in the U.S., cause for depression and substance abuse, 1,500 to 2,000 murders per year. 5 million kids witness assault on their mother every year.
- Only touching the surface, because emotional abuse is much more widespread.
- Difference in emotional vs physical isn't big, it grows from the same roots and is driven by the same thinking.
- Most abusive men simply don’t seem like abusers. So when a women feels a trouble in the relationship, she may not see it for what it is.
- Symptoms of abuse: escalating frequency of put-downs. Selfishness. Verbal explosions. Grievances. He knows what is good for her. Mounting sense of fear or irritation.
- She loves him so tries to make sense of an elaborate and evasive puzzle.
- Mood changes are especially perplexing. Puts her on the defensive, yells, is inaccessible to reason, then the next moment presents the face of a hurt child. But the beast will be back.
- Friends and other people will all have a different opinion on the abuser. Often blaming the situation partially on the victim who allegedly "triggers" the explosions.
- The woman knows from living with the abusive man that there are no simple answers.

#### Five puzzles

- His version of the abuse is worlds apart from hers.
- He gets insanely jealous, but in other ways he seems entirely rational.
- He suceeds in getting people to take his side against her, even therapists (who should always hear the woman's story, but they don't). An abusive man is not a realiable source of information on his partner.
- During some incidents he seems to lose control, but certain other controlling behaviours of his appear very calculated. They can be extremely manipulative.
- Sometimes he seems to be really changing, but it tends to vanish.

The abusive man *wants* to be a mystery. To get away with his behaviour and avoid responsibility, he needs to convince everyone that his behaviour makes no sense. He creates confusion because he has to.

He wants the woman to believe that she at least shares the blame. But abuse is not the product of bad relationship dynamics. Abuse is a problem that lies entirely with the abuser.

Inside the mind of an abuser, there is a world of beliefs, perceptions, and responses that fits together in a surprisingly logical way. Under the surface there is a human being with a comprehensible and solvable problem.

### Chapter 2: The mythology

The abuser wants you to figure him out, making you look in the wrong direction and make sense of his past, whereas the problem lies in how he thinks. He will fill your head with excuses and distorsions, and will keep you weighed down with self-doubt and self-blame.

It is a serious problem to allow abusers to analyze and account for their own problems. Because they will fool everyone.

#### A brief exercise

At the beginning of presentations, the author asks the audience to list the reasons abusers are what they are. People always come up with the common myths, and rarely with truths.

1. **He was abused as a child**

   - Weak link and other predictors are much more reliable. Usual therapy doesn't work, because it helps him develop an even more sophisticated defense system, and his pattern of abusiveness doesn't change. But special programs may bring some change.
   - By focusing on what his mother did, he can blame yet another woman.
   - Society refuses to acknowledge that it's a man's problem by blaming the mother.
   - Abusers often are litterate in psychology, turning exchanges with their partner in a therapy session for her where he outlines her supposed issues.
   - "I'm abusive because the same thing was done to me" is a common excuse, rarely stands up to reality. A non-abusive man doesn't use his past to mistreat you.
   - If you are so in touch with your abusive childhood, you should replicate it less, not more, because you know how it feels. It's just an excuse.

2. **His previous partner hurt him**

   - Pretends the woman was cheating on him, without any proof.
   - Says she wanted to control him, wouldn't let him have any freedom, turned their children against him. Usually describing his own behaviours but attributing them to the woman.
   - If it is an excuse for mistreating you, it's a distorsion: a man mistreated wouldn't use this to get away with hurting someone else. Past experiences can explain how one feels, but not how ones behaves in a "retaliatory" fashion. Stop believing anything he says.
   - If he presents himself as a victim, is aim is to play on your compassion so he can avoid dealing with his problem.

3. **He abuses those he loves the most**

   - Feelings cause behaviour? Wrong. Although our feelings can influence how we wish to act, our choices of action are determined by attitudes and habits.
   - Many people reserve their *best* behaviour to those they love most.
   - Wide acceptance in society that passion and aggression are linked to an intense relationship.

4. **He holds in his feelings too much**

   - The pressure cooker theory
   - It's wrong: most abusers express their feelings liberally and have an inflated idea of their importance. When he feels bad, he thinks that life in the family should stop until someone fixes it. "His partner’s life crises, the children’s sicknesses, meals, birthdays—nothing else matters as much as his feelings."
   - It's not *his* feelings that the abuser is too distant from, but everyone else's an in particular  his partner's and his children's. He knows very little about that.
   - Focusing on the abuser's feelings is counterproductive, that's what he wants.
   - The tension buildup is caused by his lack of empathy *for the partner's* feelings, and a set of attitudes. He explodes when he gives himself permission to do so.

5. **He has an aggressive personality**

   - A great majority of abusive men are calm and reasonable with everyone except their partner. If he had an aggressive personality, it wouldn't be reserved to their partner.
   - Class and racial stereotypes come into play (blue collar, non-white). The reality is different. Sometimes education is a weapon to tie even more intricate knots.
   - Sidenote: beware, men who intimidate other people routinely will intimidate their partner at some point too.

6. **He loses control**

   - He breaks her stuff, not his. He lets her clean up the mess.
   - He knows at which point to stop. When asked what made him stop, they can always find a reason (kids, fear of police, etc). Most common one: "*I would never do that to her*". So he does not really lose control, does he?
   - An abuser almost never does anything that he himself considers morally unacceptable. He may hide what he does because he thinks others would disagree with him, but feels justified inside.
   - He never ever says: “There’s no way I can defend what I did. It was just totally wrong.”
   - An abuser's core problem is that he has a distorted sense of right and wrong.
   - "*you can't call your mother a bitch*" (but your partner, yes) so it's not that much of a loss of control. He thinks mistreating his partner is justifiable.
   - think of an abuser as an acrobat in a circus ring who does “go wild” to some extent but who never forgets where the limits are.

7. **He is too angry**

   - Anger doesn't cause abuse, it's the other way around.
   - Everybody gets angry at times, but they don't necessarily abuse their partner.
   - The abuser’s explosive anger can divert your attention from all the disrespect, irresponsibility, talking over you, lying, and other abusive and controlling behaviors that he exhibits even at times when he isn’t especially upset.

8. **He is mentally ill**

   - He may look insane at times, unstable, or paranoid. But he in fact works "normally", not neurotically. *Their value system is wrong, not their psychology*
   - Even for the physically violent ones, there's no particular mental condition that is common to any large number of them.
   - Mental illness doesn't cause abusiveness any more than alcohol does. The man's optional psychatric problem interacts with his abusiveness to form a volatile combination.
   - Abusiveness cannot be medicated. 

9. **He hates women**

   - Just not true, they get on well with most.
   - Disrespect for women is rampant among abusive men, however. More subtle and pervasive.
   - Men who have abusive mothers don't become abusive, but those who have abusive fathers tend to much more.

10. **He is afraid of intimacy and abandonment**

    - Abusers are often jealous and possessive, and this can escalate during breakup. But breakups and abandonment don't make most people violent.
    - wrong theory: abuser uses his periodic cruelty to keep his partner from getting too close to him emotionally, a behavior which, in the language of psychologists, is called mediating the intimacy. Same as above, plus several other flaws in the theory (timing makes no sense in particular)

11. **He has low self-esteem**

    - The woman will tend to massage his ego, hoping that she can avoid the next explosion. It doesn't work. He gets used to the luxury and demands more.
    - An abuser can feel remorse and shame for what he did, but this is a consequence of his action, not a cause.
    - The woman whose self-esteem is destroyed doesn't turn into an abuser. Low self-esteem isn't a cause.

12. **His boss mistreats him**

    - Classic misconception of violence going down the ladder, not true in reality.

    - Never once had a client whose behaviour at home improved because his job situation improved.

13. **He has poor skills in communication and conflict resolution**

    - Not *unable* to resolve conflicts non abusively, he is *unwilling* to do so.

14. **There are as many abusive women as abusive men**

    - Just not real.
    - Abusive men usually like to play the victim, complaining about an abusive woman.

15. **His abusiveness is as bad for him as for his partner**

    - Abuse doesn't stop a career, friendships, etc. Abusers don't hit rock bottom. They *benefit* from their controlling behaviour. Life is certainly not equally hard for the men.

16. **He is a victim of racism**

    - The demographic doesn't support that claim (majority is white, etc)
    - Cannot be used as an excuse again. Being subject to discrimination doesn't make you violent against someone else than the source of discrimination.

17. **He abuses alcohol or drugs**

    - Alcohol cannot create an abuser, and sobriety cannot cure one.

### Chapter 3: the abusive mentality

#### Reality #1: he is controlling

- Arguments and decision making: “If my control and authority seem to be slipping, I have the right to take steps to reestablish the rule of my will, including abuse if necessary.”
- Personal freedom: expects his partner to give him a medal for his generosity, not to criticize him for his oppressiveness. He sees himself as a reasonably permissive parent—toward his adult partner.
- Parenting: properly. His arrogance about the superiority of his parenting judgment may be matched only by how little he truly understands, or pays attention to, the children’s needs.
- THE ABUSIVE MAN CLAIMS that his control is in his partner’s best interest.
- *“Your problem is not that you lose control of yourself, it’s that you take control of your partner. In order to change, you don’t need to gain control over yourself, you need to let go of control of her.”*

#### Reality #2: he feels entitled

The abuser thinks he has more rights than his partner and kids.

- **Physical caretaking**: expects his partner to take care of house and the rest. Entitled to criticize if things are not to his liking. Not out of date, still alive and well.
- expects his partner to provide **emotional caretaking**, and blows up when she doesn't anticipate unexpressed needs and desires.
- the abuser often hides his high emotional demands under a varnish of rationality (money, etc).
- feeding his entitlement will never be enough.
- **Sexual caretaking** means that he considers it his partner’s duty to keep him sexually satisfied. He may not accept having his sexual advances rejected, yet turn her down whenever he feels like it. Even her pleasure exists for his benefit: If she doesn’t reach orgasm, for example, he may resent her for it because he wants the pleasure of seeing himself as a great lover.
- **Deference**: the partner is supposed to accept his views (even the negative ones towards herself).
- **Freedom from accountability**: he considers himself above criticism. 

An abusive partner doesn't have a problem with his violence, but with his partner's violence. He takes away the right to be angry at him. Expression of anger is met with an accusation of irrationality.

He isn't abusive because he's angry, but he's angry because he is abusive.

#### Reality #3: he twists things into their opposites

The abuser reverses aggression and self-defense. When the victim defends herself he calls it aggression because he's the only one entitled to yelling; she's supposed to be listening, not talking.

#### Reality #4: he disrespects his partner and considers himself superior to her

The abuser tends to see his partner as less intelligent, less competent, less logical, and even less sensitive than he is: **objectification** or **depersonalization**, sustained by use of foul language. The abuser protects himself from empathy and guilt this way.

Abuse and respect are diametric opposites: You do not respect someone whom you abuse, and you do not abuse someone whom you respect.

#### Reality #5: he confuses love and abuse

It isn't really love; what he is feeling is:

- The desire to have you devote your life to keeping him happy with no outside interference
- The desire to have sexual access
- The desire to impress others by having you be his partner
- The desire to possess and control you

Genuine love means respecting the humanity of the other person, wanting what is best for him or her, and supporting the other person’s self-esteem and independence. This kind of love is incompatible with abuse and coercion.

#### Reality #6: he is manipulative

- Frequent and abrupt change of mood.
- Deny the obvious about his feelings or actions.
- Convince you that what he wants you to do is best for you.
- Getting you to feel sorry for him.
- Getting you to blame yourself or blame other people for his actions.
- Using confusion tactics in arguments.
- Lying or misleading you about his actions, desires, or reasong for doing certain things.
- Getting you and the people you care about turned against each other.

#### Reality #7: he strives to have a good public image

Makes the victim wonder what is wrong with *her* since he is different for everyone else.

- Enraged at home but calm and smiling outside Selfish and self-centered with you but generous and supportive with others
- Domineering at home but willing to negotiate and compromise outside
- Highly negative about females while on his own turf but a vocal supporter of equality when anyone else is listening
- Assaultive toward his partner or children but nonviolent and nonthreatening with everyone else
- Entitled at home but critical of other men who disrespect or assault women

Do they have split personalities? Not really. The nice guy front helps him feel good about himself, and hide the ugly side.

#### Reality #8: he just feels justified

- “She knows how to push my buttons.”

- Abusive men are masters of excuse making. In this respect they are like substance abusers, who believe that everyone and everything except them is responsible for their actions. They feel entitled on top of that.

#### Reality #9: Abusers deny and minimize their abuse

- Denial and minimization are part of most destructive behavior patterns, whether they be alcohol abuse, gambling, or child abuse. Partner abuse is no exception.

#### Reality #10: Abusers are possessive

- They think they own their partner, especially after a long relationship, and can behave as they see fit.
- Possessiveness often takes the form of sexual jealousy, monitoring her carefully.
- He wants to isolate her to focus on his needs, and prevent her from reaching out to others



*In reality, abuse springs from a man’s early cultural training, his key male role models, and his peer influences. In other words, abuse is a problem of values, not of psychology. When someone challenges an abuser’s attitudes and beliefs, he tends to reveal the contemptuous and insulting personality that normally stays hidden, reserved for private attacks on his partner. An abuser tries to keep everybody—his partner, his therapist, his friends and relatives—focused on how he feels, so that they won’t focus on how he thinks, perhaps because on some level he is aware that if you grasp the true nature of his problem, you will begin to escape his domination.*
